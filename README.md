# Community-Networks: A GENI network topology representing community networks

Availability of computers and Internet has increased greatly since the world wide webs onset, yet still Internet remains inaccessible in some rural and low-income parts of the world. Commercial Internet Service Provider's are essentially the only form of high-speed internet access people have, limiting the consumers choices and setting inescapable high prices. These providers can even prevent people from getting Internet by refusing to extend network lines to certain areas, usually in rural territories, as there is not much demand and they will not make significant profit. Community networks have been presented as a potential solution to the problem of Internet availability.

This image shows the computer and Internet usage of households in the United States, split into 4 different income brackets. There is a huge disparity between computer/Internet usage for households with higher incomes and households with lower incomes. We can connect computer/Internet usage with computer/Internet access, because presumably if you have access you will have usage, and if you do not have access you cannot have usage. Households with higher incomes (>75k) have nearly 100% Internet usage or access, while households with lower incomes (<25k) have around 50% usage, showing that those with lower incomes often cannot obtain Internet access.

Community networks are an alternate way for underserved areas to obtain Internet connection. They are run by the users, for the users, without the need for ISPs (although they can be used to accompany ISPs). Each individual person can become a node, in which they can obtain Internet access as well as provide others with it. A popular example of one is Guifi in Spain. They are a successful community network (and the biggest) with over 20,000 nodes, stemming from a rural area of Catalonia which had no ISPs to provide to them. An inspiring community network is one in Sarantaporo, Greece. This agricultural region had never had Internet access, and were basically isolated from the world, and each other. They were able to build a wireless community network that connected the many different villages in the region, to enliven their economy and allow better access to basic services like medical aid. The villages were able to communicate with each other through the network, as well as the rest of the world. The villagers are excited to get up in the morning and check the common website, where they can interact and organize events.
