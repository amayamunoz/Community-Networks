# Community-Networks: A GENI network topology representing community networks

Availability of computers and Internet has increased greatly since the world wide webs onset, yet still Internet remains inaccessible in some rural and low-income parts of the world. Commercial ISP's are essentially the only form of high-speed internet access people have, limiting the consumers choices and setting inescapable high prices. These providers can even prevent people from getting Internet by refusing to extend network lines to certain areas, usually in rural territories, as there is not much demand and they will not make significant profit. Community networks have been presented as a potential solution to the problem of Internet availability.
